~~The code is abysmal and not in a self-depricating way this time.~~ Actually kind of proud with how it looks now.

Threw this bad boy together in a few days. Fairly straight forward. You can input a certain quantity of equipment you would like for the randomizer to draw from (min: 0, max: 22), and it will randomize what equipment you get, what map you investigate on, and the difficulty of the investigation. I also wanted to include a challenge randomizer, so you can choose to randomize a challenge if you'd like. 

You can opt-out of any element of the randomizer if you want, I mean, I can't stop you so go for it lmao.

This was my first project using PyScript, and I have to say I am infatuated with it. Python is the only language I somewhat have a grasp on, so JS and all that jazz was completely out of the question for me. I dont really have an interest for web stuff, so having the option for python was a no brainer. I also took this opportunity to learn a bit of HTML and CSS which I had also had a very loose understanding of.
